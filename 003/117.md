# Wrong implementation:_K_ should be greater than 0.

## Summary
There is wrong implementation of _K_ as it in the comment it is shown it should be greater than 0. but we have implemented that it can be 0.

## Vulnerability Detail
k should be greater than 0 and less than 10**18 as it is shown in the comment.
require(k <= 10**18);
        _K_ = k;

here K can be less than 0;
