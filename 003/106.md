# Incorrect validation of `k` value

## Summary
The variable `k` should be greater than 0 and less than 10**18. However, currently, only the upper limit is checked during initialization, which means `k` could potentially be initialized as zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
// i should be greater than 0 and less than 10**36
require(i > 0 && i <= 10**36);
_I_ = i;
// k should be greater than 0 and less than 10**18
require(k <= 10**18);
_K_ = k;
```

## Impact
If `k` is initialized as zero, the curve becomes a straight line, causing the price to remain constant. This could potentially drain the pool of liquidity.

## Recommendation
Add a validation check ensuring that k is greater than zero.
