# Missing lower bound check for  K (Swap curve parameter)

## Summary
In the` GSP.sol` contract, the parameter  `K`  plays a significant role in initialization and the parameter K is missing the lower bound check.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Swap curve parameter` K` lacks the lower bound check and only has the upper bound check, the developer has clearly mentioned in the comment that K should be greater than zero but failed to add lower bound checks to it, it is extremely important to add a lower bound check to` K `when we need the` K` to be Greater than 0. 
## Impact
May cause unusual behaviors

` require(k <= 10**18);`
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add lower bound check to the code to avoid any unusual behavior. 
` require(k >0  && <= 10**18);`
