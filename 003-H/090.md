# due to lack of proper logic for `buyShares()` function,attacker can steal the user funds silently

## Summary
in `GSPFuding.sol` i found that `buyShares()` function has no proper access control/logic, by frontrunning attacker can steal the user tokens by minting the LP tokens to his address and sell them using `sellShares()` function.in this case user completely lose his base and quote tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
`GSPFuding.sol` contract has two important functions i.e `buyShares()` and `sellShares()` functions, by using this user can mint the Lp tokens by deposting tokens(base and quote) and burn their lp tokens and withdraw their tokens.for the `buyShares()` function User first transfer `baseToken` and `quoteToken` to GSP, then call buyShares to mint the Lp tokens . the amount of tokens transferred by user is directly calculated by

```solidity
 // The balance of baseToken and quoteToken should be the balance minus the fee
        uint256 baseBalance = _BASE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this)) - _MT_FEE_BASE_;
        uint256 quoteBalance = _QUOTE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this)) - _MT_FEE_QUOTE_;

        // The reserve of baseToken and quoteToken
        uint256 baseReserve = _BASE_RESERVE_;
        uint256 quoteReserve = _QUOTE_RESERVE_;

        // The amount of baseToken and quoteToken user transfer to GSP
        baseInput = baseBalance - baseReserve;
        quoteInput = quoteBalance - quoteReserve;
```

.after transfering the tokens to GSP ,the `buyShares()` funciton is called by the user.as the tokens are already transferred to GSP the attacker observes the pending trasaction of `buyShares()` function which is called by user and by frontrunning(as the function does not check who transferred the tokens,it only check the difference in the `Balance` and `reserve` ) and passing the attacker address to `buyShares(to)` with higher gas price, attacker mints the Lp tokens without transfering the tokens himself and the user tokens are lost and get's nothing in return

#### Exploit scenario/POC:
1)user transfers the base and quote tokens to Gsp contract
2)user call the 'buyShares()' function
3)attackers observes the pending transaction,and call's the `buyShares()` function with his address and with higher gas price
4)attackers mint's the Lp tokens and sell the LP tokens using `sellShares()` and receive the base and quote tokens
5)user transaction will be reverted as `require(baseInput > 0, "NO_BASE_INPUT");` fails

## Impact
User tokens can be steal by the attacker.

## Tool used
Vs code,Manual Review

## Recommendation
try to implement logic for transfering tokens from the user within the function, like using `safeTransferFrom`
```solidity
token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_amount);
```
