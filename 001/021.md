# GSPFunding.buyShares doesn't have slippage protection

## Summary
GSPFunding.buyShares doesn't have slippage protection which can lead to lose of funds for the users.
## Vulnerability Detail
`GSPFunding.buyShares` function is used by users to mint shares in the vault. User should provide funds and then he can get shares back. Amount of shares that he will receive depends [on the current reserves of the vault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPFunding.sol#L67-L68). Ideally user should provide both assets in correct proportion to not lose part of funds. This is because he will be given shares amount [that depends on smaller ratio](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPFunding.sol#L69-L71) of 2 tokens that he provided.

As reserves ratios change during the swaps, this means that this function needs to have slippage protection. Pls, note that `sellShares` function [has such protection](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPFunding.sol#L95-L98) and also there is no info that `GSPFunding.buyShares` should be used through the Router that will handle slippage as it's [commented for trader functions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPTrader.sol#L35C62-L35C88).
