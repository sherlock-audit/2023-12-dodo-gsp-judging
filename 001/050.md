# The protocol lacks slippage protection, which result in financial losses for users

## Summary
The protocol's functions, including buyShares(), sellBase(), and sellQuote(), currently lack essential slippage protection. During these operations, calculations are vulnerable to manipulation of state variables, potentially resulting in users receiving fewer tokens than expected. This exposes users to the risk of financial losses and creates an opportunity for sandwich attacks. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`buyShares()`, `sellBase()`, and `sellQuote()` lack slippage protection. When a user calls `buyShares()`, the protocol calculates the quantity of minted shares based on the minimum ratio of the user-input token amounts to the reserves.
```solidity
   uint256 baseInputRatio = DecimalMath.divFloor(baseInput, baseReserve);
            uint256 quoteInputRatio = DecimalMath.divFloor(quoteInput, quoteReserve);
            uint256 mintRatio = quoteInputRatio < baseInputRatio ? quoteInputRatio : baseInputRatio;
            // The shares will be minted to user
            shares = DecimalMath.mulFloor(totalSupply, mintRatio);

```


 In the `sellBase()` and `sellQuote()` functions, the protocol calls corresponding query functions to calculate the output quantities, relying on state variables.
```solidity
    function getPMMState() public view returns (PMMPricing.PMMState memory state) {
        state.i = _I_;
        state.K = _K_;
        state.B = _BASE_RESERVE_;
        state.Q = _QUOTE_RESERVE_;
        state.B0 = _BASE_TARGET_; // will be calculated in adjustedTarget
        state.Q0 = _QUOTE_TARGET_;
        state.R = PMMPricing.RState(_RState_);
        PMMPricing.adjustedTarget(state);
    }

```

These calculations are susceptible to manipulation of the underlying values in the state, potentially resulting in users receiving fewer tokens than expected, creating an opportunity for sandwich attacks.

## Impact
The absence of slippage protection results in a potential loss for the users.
