# Missing Slippage Protection in buyShares and sellShares Functions

## Summary
The buyShares and sellShares functions in the provided smart contract lack slippage protection, making them susceptible to front-running attacks and price manipulation. This could result in users receiving fewer tokens than expected or selling shares at unfavorable rates, leading to financial losses.

## Vulnerability Detail
buyShares Function
In the buyShares function, users can send a transaction to purchase tokens at a specific price. However, without slippage protection, an attacker could front-run the transaction, manipulating the price and causing the user to receive fewer tokens than initially anticipated. This scenario can lead to financial losses for the user.

sellShares Function
Similarly, in the sellShares function, users may attempt to sell their shares at a specified rate. The absence of slippage protection makes the function vulnerable to front-running attacks or rapid price changes. As a result, users might receive fewer baseToken and quoteToken than expected, leading to financial losses during the share selling process.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it exposes users to the risk of receiving fewer tokens than intended when buying or selling shares. Front-running attacks or sudden price fluctuations could result in unfavorable transaction execution, leading to financial losses for users interacting with the decentralized exchange.

    function buyShares(address to)

        returns (
            uint256 shares,
            uint256 baseInput,
            uint256 quoteInput
        )
    {
        // The balance of baseToken and quoteToken should be the balance minus the fee
        uint256 baseBalance = _BASE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this)) - _MT_FEE_BASE_;
        uint256 quoteBalance = _QUOTE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this)) - _MT_FEE_QUOTE_;
        ..
            shares = quoteBalance < DecimalMath.mulFloor(baseBalance, _I_)
                ? DecimalMath.divFloor(quoteBalance, _I_)
                : baseBalance;
            // The target will be updated
            _BASE_TARGET_ = uint112(shares);
            _QUOTE_TARGET_ = uint112(DecimalMath.mulFloor(shares, _I_));
        } else if (baseReserve > 0 && quoteReserve > 0) {
          ..
            shares = DecimalMath.mulFloor(totalSupply, mintRatio);
          .. 
        _mint(to, shares);
        _setReserve(baseBalance, quoteBalance);
    ..
    }

    function sellShares(
        uint256 shareAmount,
        address to,
        uint256 baseMinAmount,
        uint256 quoteMinAmount,
        bytes calldata data,

    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 baseAmount, uint256 quoteAmount) {
         
        // The amount of baseToken and quoteToken user will receive is calculated by the ratio of user's shares to total shares
        baseAmount = baseBalance * shareAmount / totalShares;
        quoteAmount = quoteBalance * shareAmount / totalShares;
        ...
        // The shares will be burned from user
        // The baseToken and quoteToken will be transferred to user
        // The reserve will be synced
        _burn(msg.sender, shareAmount);
        _transferBaseOut(to, baseAmount);
        _transferQuoteOut(to, quoteAmount);
        _sync();
   ...
    }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the risk of front-running attacks and protect users from financial losses due to price fluctuations, it is crucial to implement slippage protection in both the buyShares and sellShares functions. By introducing slippage checks, the contract can revert transactions that exceed the specified slippage tolerance:

    // Set slippage tolerance (in basis points)
    uint256 private constant SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE = 100; // 1%

    // Check slippage tolerance in buyShares
    require(quoteInput * 100 <= quoteBalance * (100 + SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE), "Slippage exceeded");

    // Check slippage tolerance in sellShares
    require(baseAmount * 100 <= baseBalance * (100 + SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE), "Slippage exceeded");
    require(quoteAmount * 100 <= quoteBalance * (100 + SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE), "Slippage exceeded");
