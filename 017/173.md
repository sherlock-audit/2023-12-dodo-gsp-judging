# Malicious attacker can drain funds via `flashLoan` function

## Summary

An attacker could exploit the function to obtain a flash loan without doing any previous transfer by updating the reserves during callback.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises from the ability to manipulate reserves through the `sync` function within the `flashLoan` callback. An attacker, by creating a contract implementing `IDODOCallee` with a callback function ` DSPFlashLoanCall`  that calls `.sync()` function, can update the reserves during the process, which allows him to bypass any balance checks.

By executing the `sync` function the following checks will pass :

```javascript
require(
                (uint256(_BASE_RESERVE_) - baseBalance) <= receiveBaseAmount,
                "FLASH_LOAN_FAILED"
            );
require(
                (uint256(_QUOTE_RESERVE_) - quoteBalance) <= receiveQuoteAmount,
                "FLASH_LOAN_FAILED"
            );
```
Because when the reserve sync up both :

`uint256(_BASE_RESERVE_) - baseBalance = 0`

&&

`uint256(_QUOTE_RESERVE_) - quoteBalance = 0`

The checks will pass which allows the attacker to take/swaps tokens without any transfers.

## Impact

Attacker can drain the funds of depositors.

## Recommendation
Consider removing the callback `DSPFlashLoanCall` or adding it only after the checks/requires of balances.
