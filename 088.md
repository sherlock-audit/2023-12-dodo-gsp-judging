# Missing Invariant Check in `DODOMath.sol`

## Summary
The `DODOMath.sol` contract lacks a critical invariant check to ensure that the values `V0`, `V1`, and `V2` follow the required condition `V0 >= V1 >= V2 > 0`. This missing check could lead to incorrect calculations or unintended behavior in the contract's mathematical operations.


## Vulnerability Detail
In the `DODOMath.sol` contract, the function responsible for certain calculations does not validate that the input values satisfy the condition `V0 >= V1 >= V2 > 0`. This invariant is crucial for the correct functioning of the mathematical logic in the contract. Without this check, the function might process invalid or nonsensical inputs, potentially leading to erroneous outcomes.


## Impact
Failing to enforce this invariant could result in calculations that do not reflect the intended logic of the contract. This might lead to issues such as incorrect token pricing, flawed reward distributions, or other critical financial inaccuracies within the contract's operations.


## Code Snippet
- **Location of Issue**: [DODOMath.sol#L29-L44](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/lib/DODOMath.sol#L29-L44)


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add this code in  _GeneralIntegrate function
```solidity
require(V0 >= V1 && V1 >= V2 && V2 > 0, "Invariant V0 >= V1 >= V2 > 0 not satisfied");
```
