# Shares in a pool are subject to approval race condition

## Summary
Shares of a pool can be transferred and a user can approve another address to transfer a certain amount of shares on his behalf. But the current approve method does not protect against the well-known approval race condition.

## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose User A has approved User B to transfer x of his shares. When User A decides to reduce/ increase the allowance for B to Y amount of shares (probably 0 because B might have become malicious), the _approve function resets the allowance to a new value. But User B can frontrun this approve reset call and transfer the x amount of shares that had already been approved before, and still get control of the new y amount of approved tokens for further operations. 

This means A wanted B to control only Y amount of shares but he could control X+Y because he already used X by frontrunning the new approval call and thus resetting allowance from x->0, which now goes from 0 -> y, and now he can use that Y too.

## Impact
The user wanted other address to only spend Y, but they could spend X+Y, stealing the shares from user which can later be redeemed for the pool assets.
