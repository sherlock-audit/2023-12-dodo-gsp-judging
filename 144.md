# Fee amount charged by the Protocol can be circumvented for low-decimal Stablecoins

## Summary
When Quote token is a low-decimal ERC20 Stablecoin , the fee collected by the protocol in `GSPTrader.sol#querySellBase` can be circumvented to 0 for smaller deposits.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's consider the example where Base Token is USDC and Quote Token is a token like [GeminiUSD](https://etherscan.io/token/0x056Fd409E1d7A124BD7017459dFEa2F387b6d5Cd) which is a token with 300M+ market cap, which is widely used StableCoin. 
Now see this piece of code:
```solidity
 function querySellBase(address trader, uint256 payBaseAmount)
        public
        view
        returns (
            uint256 receiveQuoteAmount,
            uint256 mtFee,
            PMMPricing.RState newRState,
            uint256 newBaseTarget
        )
    {
        PMMPricing.PMMState memory state = getPMMState();
        (receiveQuoteAmount, newRState) = PMMPricing.sellBaseToken(state, payBaseAmount);

        uint256 lpFeeRate = _LP_FEE_RATE_;
        uint256 mtFeeRate = _MT_FEE_RATE_;
 @>  mtFee = DecimalMath.mulFloor(receiveQuoteAmount, mtFeeRate);
        receiveQuoteAmount = receiveQuoteAmount
 @>       - DecimalMath.mulFloor(receiveQuoteAmount, lpFeeRate)
            - mtFee;
        newBaseTarget = state.B0;
    }
```
Let's say the `mtFeeRate` is about 1% and let's say an amount of 8 DAI(8e18) has been put to sale which would give the receiveQuoteAmount to be about 7.8 GeminiUSD(7.8e2). In this case the fee calculated will be round to zero.

## Impact
The protocol doesn't collect fees from Vaults with low decimal StableCoin as the Quote Tokens .

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding zero checks for these cases and if the fee circumvents to 0,then use a constant fee for those cases
