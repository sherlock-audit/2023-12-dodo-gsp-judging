# Missing Slippage And Deadline Check on Flashloan

## Summary 

## Vulnerability Detail

_Note: The sellBase and sellQuote need slippage and deadline parameters as they are swaps. I excluded sellBase and sellQuote because they are specified as "go through router"._ 

The flashloan function also needs these slippage parameters too as they are implicitly swapping tokens. The paramters of the functions that call flashloan in the `IDodoCallee.sol` file. As shown, these calling functions here also have no slippage and deadline parameters. 

The lack of deadline exacerbates the lack of slippage, as then the transaction could have a delay and the period could result in a change in `BASE_TOKEN` and `QUOTE_TOKEN` price leading to the internal swap being arbitraged.

## Impact

Lack of slippage and parameters in flashloan including swaps can cause losses frontrunning
