# Missing Zero Address Check in `GSP.sol`

## Summary
The `GSP.sol` contract lacks necessary checks to prevent the `maintainer`, `baseTokenAddress`, and `quoteTokenAddress` from being set to the zero address. This oversight can lead to critical issues in the contract's functionality, as these addresses are fundamental to its operations.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `GSP.sol` contract, the addresses for `maintainer`, `baseTokenAddress`, and `quoteTokenAddress` are set without validating whether they are the zero address (0x0). The absence of this validation can result in these critical addresses being inadvertently set to the zero address, leading to malfunctioning of the contract and potential loss of funds or access control.


## Impact
If any of these addresses are set to the zero address, it could render the contract non-functional or vulnerable to exploits. For instance, a zero `maintainer` address could lead to loss of administrative control, while zero token addresses could disrupt token transfer and exchange functionalities.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement checks to ensure that maintainer, baseTokenAddress, and quoteTokenAddress are not set to the zero address during contract initialization or any subsequent updates.
