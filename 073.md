# GPSFunding::buyShares A malicious user can sandwich buyShares and ensure buyer gets zero shares

## Summary
A malicious LP whale can sandwich a transaction calling `buyShares`, doing a big swap to ensure that reserve in one token is very big. Since the minimum ratio is used to mint shares, the attacker can swap back and sell his inflated shares to a profit. 

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see in GPSFunding::buyShares:

```solidity
    uint256 baseInputRatio = DecimalMath.divFloor(baseInput, baseReserve);
    uint256 quoteInputRatio = DecimalMath.divFloor(quoteInput, quoteReserve);
    //@audit the smaller ratio is used for the mint
    uint256 mintRatio = quoteInputRatio < baseInputRatio ? quoteInputRatio : baseInputRatio;
    // The shares will be minted to user
    shares = DecimalMath.mulFloor(totalSupply, mintRatio);
```

The minimum of the two ratios is used to mint shares, making the following scenario possible

### Scenario

Consider the pool USDC/USDT with:

>I = 1e18
>k = 0
>lpFee = 0


(parameters chosen for simplicity)

The pool contains initially 1M USDC and 1M USDT

- Alice sends a transaction to `buyShares` for 1M USDC and 1M USDT to the public mempool, and should receive 100% of the current total supply in shares
- Bob who is a big LP in the pool sees the transaction and sandwiches it:
    - front-run with a big swap setting USDT reserve to 2M and USDC reserve is very small
    - back-run with a big swap getting back USDT
- As a result Alice gets 50% of the current totalSupply in shares (based on the USDT ratio) 
- Bob sells his shares at a big profit

## Impact
Adding liquidity is not safe on a stable pool, since a sandwich can steal an arbitrary amount of the funds provided

Add a slippage parameter to ensure that the share buyer get intended number of shares
