# a ceiling division in reserve updates could lead to an imbalance in share value

## Summary
- In the `sellShares` function, we have both `_BASE_TARGET_` and `_QUOTE_TARGET_ `they get updated after a user sells their share. and we  have the contract uses `DecimalMath._divCeil` in `DecimalMath.sol` contract for the calculation of the new target values, which implements a division that rounds up any fractional remainder to the next whole number.
the problem is If `_BASE_TARGET_` or `_QUOTE_TARGET_` is updated in such a way that the rounding leads to more tokens being subtracted from the target than the actual number of tokens represented by the seller’s shares, it could create a slight imbalance in the reserve, effectively causing a loss to the seller. In a pool with many transactions occurring, this could be exploited in a way that incrementally decreases the value of shares held by LPs over time Due to _divCeil potentially rounding up during each sell transaction, extra tokens can deducted from the targets, slowly depleting the reserve in relation to the shares outstanding. This imbalance would slowly disfavor the LPs, as they might receive slightly fewer tokens than they are entitled to based on their share of the total supply due to the upward rounding of the target reserves.

## Vulnerability Detail
- here is`_divCeil`  function in the the` DecimalMath.sol` contract :

```solidity
 function _divCeil(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 quotient = a / b;
        uint256 remainder = a - quotient * b;
        if (remainder > 0) {
            return quotient + 1;
        } else {
            return quotient;
        }
    }
}

```
- and here the function `sellShares` that contain the vulenrbale part in the `GSPFunding.sol `contract :

```solidity
        // The target will be updated
        _BASE_TARGET_ = uint112(uint256(_BASE_TARGET_) - DecimalMath._divCeil((uint256(_BASE_TARGET_) * (shareAmount)), totalShares));
        _QUOTE_TARGET_ = uint112(uint256(_QUOTE_TARGET_) - DecimalMath._divCeil((uint256(_QUOTE_TARGET_) * (shareAmount)), totalShares));
        
```

- let's as an example where the rounding effect of _divCeil leads to the reduction of targets by more than their proportional share:
let say we have :
     - Initial _BASE_TARGET_: 10,000
     - Total supply of shares (totalShares): 1,000
     - The seller wants to sell (shareAmount): 111 shares
Regular division would mean:
      (10,000 * 111) / 1000 = 1,110
But with the _divCeil function, if there’s even a slight remainder, for example:
      (10,001 * 111) / 1000 = 1,110.111
The _divCeil would round up:
      1,110.111 effectively becomes 1,111
the _BASE_TARGET_ would be reduced by 1,111 instead of 1,110. Over time and many similar transactions, the base target would be lowered more than justified by the sold shares, meaning the remaining shareholders indirectly lose a small amount of their equity within the pool with each rounded transaction.
## Impact
the issue can lead This could result in liquidity providers receiving less value when withdrawing than is correctly proportionate to their shareholdings

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- it's recommended to replace the ceiling division when computing the proportion of the reserves to be reduced with standard division
as an example :
```solidity
BASE_TARGET = uint112(uint256(BASE_TARGET) - (uint256(BASE_TARGET) * shareAmount) / totalShares);
QUOTE_TARGET = uint112(uint256(QUOTE_TARGET) - (uint256(QUOTE_TARGET) * shareAmount) / totalShares); 
```
