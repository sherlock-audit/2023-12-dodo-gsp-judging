# First Depositor Forced to Deposit at Inaccurate Token Ratio

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_I_` price between the base and quote token is not meant to be an updated and precisely accurate reflection of the true price between the two tokens. It is only updated when the `maintainer` updates the price manually.

This price is used during the first deposit, when `totalShares==0` rather than allowing the user to input an exchange ratio.

```solidity
 if (totalSupply == 0) { 
     shares = quoteBalance < DecimalMath.mulFloor(baseBalance, _I_) 
```

Since the `_I_` price is not necessarily up-to-date or accurate, this initial liquidity depositor has to overpay for their liquidity shares, and the deposit can immediately be arbitraged by another user which pushes the reserves to reflect the up-to -date price.

If the user could set the reserveRatio at the beginning, they are incentivsed to set it to reflect the true price of the asset as this gives the maxiumum liquidity they could get for the underlying token value.

## Impact

First liquidity depositor overpays for liquidity especially when there is significant deviation between `_I_` and the real price of tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow the user to choose their own token ratio during the first deposit rather than enforcing the ratio set by `_I_`
