# Inaccurate Fee Handling due to Decimals Mismatch

## Summary

The `GSPFunding.sol` contract exhibits discrepancies in fee calculations stemming from a mismatch between token decimals. The contract is designed to operate with USDC and USDT, as it is written in the README.md, wherein USDC and USDT have 6 decimals while the associated fees are configured at 18 decimals. This mismatch leads to inaccurate balance calculations, potentially resulting in asset losses for users.

```solidity
     * @param lpFeeRate The rate of lp fee, with 18 decimal
     * @param mtFeeRate The rate of mt fee, with 18 decimal
```

## Vulnerability Detail

The `GSPFunding.sol` contract encompasses functions for LP token minting and burning, particularly within the `buyShares` and `sellShares` functions. In the `buyShares` function, the computation of baseBalance relies on `_BASE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this)) - _MT_FEE_BASE_;`, assuming fees are subtracted from the base token balance. However, this approach lacks compatibility with the defined token decimals. As USDC and USDT operate with 6 decimals and the fees are set at 18 decimals, this calculation methodology becomes erroneous.
The same is true in the `sellShares` function.

## Impact

Users engaging in token minting or burning operations might experience asset losses or unexpected discrepancies in their balances due to flawed calculations.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Align the fee configurations and balance calculations with the specific token decimals (i.e., 6 decimals for USDC and USDT). Ensure consistency in decimals across fee rates and token balances to prevent erroneous calculations and safeguard user assets.
