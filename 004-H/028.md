# First depositor can abuse exchange rate to steal funds from later depositors

## Summary
The buyShares function in the provided smart contract is vulnerable to a share ratio inflation exploit, commonly known as a "first depositor attack." This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the share ratio by depositing a small amount of baseToken, triggering the minting of shares, and then potentially stealing funds from later depositors due to truncation during the conversion to shares.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability stems from the way shares are minted in the buyShares function. Specifically, when the total supply of shares is zero (totalSupply == 0), the calculation of the shares variable allows an attacker to inflate their share ratio significantly. By depositing a minimal amount of baseToken, the attacker can manipulate the ratio to their advantage, potentially leading to a disproportionate share of the pool.

    if (totalSupply == 0) {
    // ... 
    shares = quoteBalance < DecimalMath.mulFloor(baseBalance, _I_)
        ? DecimalMath.divFloor(quoteBalance, _I_)
        : baseBalance;
    // ... 
    }

This condition creates an opportunity for an attacker to exploit the truncation behavior, leading to unintended consequences for later depositors.


## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it allows an attacker to distort the share ratio in their favor, potentially resulting in unfair and disproportionate allocation of funds from later depositors. This can lead to financial losses for users who deposit assets into the vault.

    {
        // The balance of baseToken and quoteToken should be the balance minus the fee
        uint256 baseBalance = _BASE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this)) - _MT_FEE_BASE_;

        uint256 baseReserve = _BASE_RESERVE_;
        uint256 quoteReserve = _QUOTE_RESERVE_;

        // The amount of baseToken and quoteToken user transfer to GSP
        baseInput = baseBalance - baseReserve;
        quoteInput = quoteBalance - quoteReserve;

        // BaseToken should be transferred to GSP before calling buyShares
        require(baseInput > 0, "NO_BASE_INPUT");

        // Round down when withdrawing. Therefore, never be a situation occuring balance is 0 but totalsupply is not 0

            // The shares will be minted to user
            shares = quoteBalance < DecimalMath.mulFloor(baseBalance, _I_)
                ? DecimalMath.divFloor(quoteBalance, _I_)
                : baseBalance;

            // The target will be updated
            _BASE_TARGET_ = uint112(shares);
            _QUOTE_TARGET_ = uint112(DecimalMath.mulFloor(shares, _I_));

        // The reserve will be updated

    }

## Recommendation
Either during creation of the vault or for first depositor, lock a small amount of the deposit to avoid this.
