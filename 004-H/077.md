# GPSFunding::buyShares First depositor inflation attack

## Summary
An early LP can use a direct donation to the pool to ensure that later share buyers end up with less shares due to rounding. 

## Vulnerability Detail
An early LP can mint some amount of shares, at least `1000` as seen in `GSPVault::_mint`.
Then by withdrawing 999 shares, `totalSupply == 1`. The LP donates a sizeable amount to the pool in each token: 1k$ for quote and for base.

The next depositors, will have to mint at least `1000` shares (e.g. 1M$ in value), and by doing so, can be rounded down by 1k$ of value, which inflates value of the shares of the initial depositor.

## Impact
Initial depositor forces subsequent depositors to supply at a lowered (rounded down) value, inflating the value of his own shares
