# `experimental ABIEncoderV2` Usage in `DecimalMath`, `DODOMath`, `InitializableOwnable`, and `PMMPricing` Contracts

## Summary

The project includes several contracts, namely `DecimalMath`, `DODOMath`, `InitializableOwnable`, and `PMMPricing`, that are using the `pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2` directive. However, it appears that these contracts do not require the features offered by `ABIEncoderV2`. Although newer versions of Solidity have stabilized this encoder, it's usage in older versions is considered experimental and may introduce unanticipated risks. Therefore, it's recommended to avoid using this directive in the aforementioned contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

The experimental `ABIEncoderV2` pragma is intended to manage complex data types in Solidity functions. However, in the [DecimalMath](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/af43d39f6a89e5084843e196fc0185abffe6304d/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/lib/DecimalMath.sol#L3), [DODOMath](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/af43d39f6a89e5084843e196fc0185abffe6304d/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/lib/DODOMath.sol#L3), [InitializableOwnable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/af43d39f6a89e5084843e196fc0185abffe6304d/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/lib/InitializableOwnable.sol#L9), and [PMMPricing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/af43d39f6a89e5084843e196fc0185abffe6304d/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/lib/PMMPricing.sol#L9) contracts, there seems to be no clear use of its capabilities, making it unnecessary. Besides, previous versions of Solidity had multiple problems with this encoder, which have been fixed in recent updates.

## Impact

It is important to note that using the experimental `ABIEncoderV2` in contracts can result in unexpected vulnerabilities, which may compromise the security and integrity of the contract code. Although comprehensive testing can help reduce some risks, it cannot entirely eliminate the possibility of encountering encoder-specific issues. It is recommended to exercise caution when using `ABIEncoderV2` to avoid any potential security breaches.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The recommendation is to remove the experimental `ABIEncoderV2` directive from the `DecimalMath`, `DODOMath`, `InitializableOwnable`, and `PMMPricing` contracts. This action will eliminate unnecessary risks associated with the use of experimental features. Furthermore, upgrading to a newer Solidity version where `ABIEncoderV2` is stable should be considered. If upgrading is not a viable option, rewriting the contracts to leverage the stable version of the encoder in the current Solidity version is advised to ensure enhanced security and contract stability.
