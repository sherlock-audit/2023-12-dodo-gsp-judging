# In "_SolveQuadraticFunctionForTrade", there is a loss of precision due to incorrect ordering of multiplications and divisions during calculations.

## Summary

In `_SolveQuadraticFunctionForTrade`, loss of accuracy due to incorrect order of multiplication and division during calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail

In function `_SolveQuadraticFunctionForTrade` of `DODOMath.sol`, the code snippet:

```solidity
} else {
     temp = delta * (V1) / (V0) * (i) / (V0);
}
```

suffers from precision loss as the incorrect order of multiplication and division.

For example, when delta = 100, V1 = 100, V0 = 3000 and i=500000, temp will be equal to 500. However, if temp = delta * (V1) * (i) / (V0) / (V0), the calculated result will be 555. 

## Impact

## Recommendation

The correct calculation formula should be:

```solidity
temp = delta * (V1) * (i) / (V0) / (V0)
```
