# DOMAIN_SEPARATOR will remain the same even after a hard-fork

## Summary
It was so hard for me to detect what severity is for this issue (because i know the Low severity issues will be invalidated by Sherlock), then after discussion with the sponsor, they confirmed and also i saw the same issue is previously accepted as Medium in other contests (see provided link in below), then i decided to submit this issue:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-golom-findings/issues/391
And also the same bug is reported by TrailOfBits as a High Severity Issue here:
https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/LooksRare.pdf

## Vulnerability Detail
As we see the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR is calculated in [init](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/af43d39f6a89e5084843e196fc0185abffe6304d/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSP.sol#L86-L95) which can be called only [once](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/af43d39f6a89e5084843e196fc0185abffe6304d/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSP.sol#L45-L47) (it means no body is able to call `init` after a hard-fork to recompute the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR):
```solidity
function init(
        address maintainer,
        address baseTokenAddress,
        address quoteTokenAddress,
        uint256 lpFeeRate,
        uint256 mtFeeRate,
        uint256 i,
        uint256 k,
        bool isOpenTWAP
    ) external {
        // ...
        // ============================== Permit ====================================
        uint256 chainId;
        assembly {
            chainId := chainid()
        }
        // DOMAIN_SEPARATOR is used for approve by signature
        DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = keccak256(
            abi.encode(
                // keccak256('EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)'),
                0x8b73c3c69bb8fe3d512ecc4cf759cc79239f7b179b0ffacaa9a75d522b39400f,
                keccak256(bytes(name)),
                keccak256(bytes("1")),
                chainId,
                address(this)
            )
        );
        // ==========================================================================
    }
```
This means even after hard fork, DOMAIN_SEPARATOR value will remain same and point to incorrect chainId and this may cause unexpected situation for signer.
Due to that the protocol will be deployed on many networks (e.g Ethereum, Arbitrum, Aurora, Avalanche, etc), the risk of this issue highly increases.

## Impact
If there is ever a hardfork for any network (e.g Ethereum, Arbitrum, Aurora, Avalanche, etc) DOMAIN_SEPARATOR value will become invalid. This is because the chainId parameter is computed in `init` which works like a constructor (it is no longer available after it is called). This means even after hard fork chainId would remain same which is incorrect and could cause possible replay attacks

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider updating DOMAIN_SEPARATOR when the chainId has been changed.
