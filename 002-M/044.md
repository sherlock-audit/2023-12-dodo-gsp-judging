# Possible case of replay attacks

## Summary
If there is ever a hardfork for any if the supported chains (chances are higher, since there's a lot), the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` value will become invalid. This is because the chainId parameter is computed in initializer. This means even after hard fork chainId would remain same which is incorrect and could cause possible replay attacks. Considering that the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is used to verify approval permit signature in the GSPVault. The risk of replay attack could have spenders getting more approvals down required. 

## Vulnerability Detail
As can be seen from the initializer, the chainId is derived and then hardcoded in `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR`. This means even after hard fork, `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` value will remain same and point to incorrect chainId.

```solidity
    function init(
        address maintainer,
        address baseTokenAddress,
        address quoteTokenAddress,
        uint256 lpFeeRate,
        uint256 mtFeeRate,
        uint256 i,
        uint256 k,
        bool isOpenTWAP
    ) external {
        ...
        // ============================== Permit ====================================
        uint256 chainId;
        assembly {
            chainId := chainid()
        }
        // DOMAIN_SEPARATOR is used for approve by signature
        DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = keccak256(
            abi.encode(
                // keccak256('EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)'),
                0x8b73c3c69bb8fe3d512ecc4cf759cc79239f7b179b0ffacaa9a75d522b39400f,
                keccak256(bytes(name)),
                keccak256(bytes("1")),
                chainId,
                address(this)
            )
        );
        ...
    }
 ```
Its subsequent use in the `GSPVault` permit function leaves the user's signature to replay attacks.

```solidity
    function permit(
            ...
        bytes32 digest =
            keccak256(
                abi.encodePacked(
                    "\x19\x01",
                    DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
                  ...
        _approve(owner, spender, value);
    }
}
```

## Impact
Replay attacks to maliciously increase approval.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider recomputing the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` everytime by placing current value of chainId.
