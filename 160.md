# use of tx.origin is not recommonded

## Summary
In `GSPTrader` contract ,  `sellBase` ,  `sellQuote` and `flashLoan` functions are  using `tx.origin` which is not a good practice and exposes the contract to attacks
## Vulnerability Detail
The use of` tx.origin` poses a potential vulnerability by referencing the initial external account or contract that initiated the transaction. While `tx.origin` identifies the first external entity that triggered the transaction, it may not represent the ultimate initiator in complex transaction chains.
For instance, consider a scenario where Contract A initiates an external call to Contract B, and then Contract B, in turn, initiates another external call to Contract C. In this multistep transaction chain, Contract C, if using `tx.origin` for verification purposes, would retrieve the address of Contract A as the transaction initiator, rather than Contract B, which directly interacts with Contract C.
This discrepancy in identification can lead to incorrect assumptions about the transaction's origin, potentially causing:
Misattributed Permissions: Contracts relying on `tx.origin` might grant or deny permissions based on an incorrect assumption of the transaction initiator. This can lead to unauthorized access or incorrect authorization decisions.

Security Risks: Verification or access control mechanisms based on `tx.origin` might mistakenly assume certain security contexts, opening the contract to exploitation or unexpected behavior from external contracts.

In the GSPTrader contract also, `tx.origin` is used in multiple functions like  `sellBase` ,  `sellQuote` and `flashLoan`
which exposes the contract to a lot of risks.
## Impact
Incorrect Attribution: `tx.origin` may misattribute the initiator of a transaction, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about the true originator, especially in complex contract interactions.
Security Risks: Relying on `tx.origin` for access control or authentication can introduce vulnerabilities, enabling unauthorized access or granting incorrect permissions.
Exploitation: Malicious actors might manipulate transaction chains to deceive contracts relying on `tx.origin`, leading to unexpected behaviors or unauthorized actions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use `msg.sender` instead. because `msg.sender` represent the last account/contract that initiated the transaction unlike `tx.origin` reducing various security risks .
