# GSPVault::adjustPrice A user can sandwich adjust price to extract some funds from the LPs

## Summary
A malicious user can front-run adjust price and extract a big chunk of value from a pool

## Vulnerability Detail
`adjustPrice` is a function enabling a MAINTAINER to change the ideal price of base asset with regards to quote.
Unfortunately as an admin changes the parameter, a user can sandwich the transaction to profit. The impact will be more apparent on pools where the parameter `K` is small/zero, since the price actually paid for an asset is then very close to `I`.

### Scenario
Consider the pool for Quote `Q` and Base `B` with a initial ideal price `I1`
For the simplicity of the example we'll consider `K == 0` for this pool. 
Such as B is priced with regards to quote simply as:
```math
    B = I*Q
```

- Maintainer sends a transaction to change I1 to I2 (> I1) to the public mempool
- Alice sees the transaction and sandwiches it:
    - front-run with a tx buying all of the supply of Base
    - back-run with a tx selling all of the base obtained previously since price is now higher

The reverse trivially works when the change is from I1 to I2 where `I1 > I2`

Note that this manipulation is profitable if the change in price `(I2-I1)/I1` is greater than `lpFee+mtFee`

## Impact
An attacker can steal some funds from the LPs when the maintainer adjusts ideal price between quote and base

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a timelock feature to be able to adjust the price without being front-run
