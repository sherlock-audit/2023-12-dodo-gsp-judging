# Potential Front-Running Vulnerability in GSP Contract's Initialization Process

## Summary
Init function in GSP contract is open to be called for everyone. In the first transaction someone can deploy the GSP contract and in a second one he has to call init to initialize it's state. A frontrunner can exploit this to "steal" the initialization.

## Vulnerability Detail
A frontrunner can listen to the mempool and check if there is a transaction for deployment and another for initialization and then sneak a transaction in between in order to steal the initialization from the original deployer.

## Impact
Because of the front-running transaction, the original deployer's init function is reverted and the GSP contract has strange or convenient for the attacker state/data.
For example the deployer didn't want the TWAP to be available but the attacker initialize the TWAP to be available.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Limit the access to the init function in the GSP contract to the deployer or to a set of trusted addresses, employing proper access control to prevent unauthorized initialization.
