# Front-Running Vulnerability in `GSP.sol` Initialization Function

## Summary
The `init` function in the `GSP.sol` contract is vulnerable to front-running and can be called by any user. This lack of access control poses a significant security risk, as unauthorized users could initialize the contract with arbitrary parameters.


## Vulnerability Detail
In the current implementation of the `GSP.sol` contract, the `init` function, which is responsible for initializing key contract parameters, does not have any access control mechanisms. This allows any external actor to call the function, potentially initializing the contract with malicious or unintended settings.


## Impact
If an attacker successfully front-runs the legitimate initialization transaction, they could set critical contract parameters, such as `maintainer`, `baseTokenAddress`, and `quoteTokenAddress`, to values under their control or to invalid addresses. This could lead to loss of control over the contract, misdirection of funds, or complete contract failure.

## Code Snippet
- **Location of Issue**: [GSP.sol#L34-L97](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSP.sol#L34-L97)


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Restrict access to the init function so that only the contract owner or a designated initializer can call it. This can be achieved by using modifiers like onlyOwner provided by OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract, or a custom access control mechanism.
