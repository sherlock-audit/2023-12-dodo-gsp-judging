# GSP contract does not implement IGSP Interface

## Summary
The Gas Saving Pool (GSP) contract does not fully implement all the functions defined in the IGSP interface.

## Vulnerability Detail
The IGSP interface includes a `getFeeRate()` function that is not present in the GSP contract.

## Impact
Contracts that interact with the GSP contract through the IGSP interface may experience errors due to the missing implementation of this function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either implement the `getFeeRate()` function in the GSP contract or remove it from the IGSP interface to avoid potential errors.
