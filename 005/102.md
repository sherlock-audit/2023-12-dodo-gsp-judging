# MAINTAINER can be the 0 address

## Summary
The maintainer can equal address(0): https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/af43d39f6a89e5084843e196fc0185abffe6304d/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSP.sol#L66

## Vulnerability Detail
In the GSP contract's initialization function init, the maintainer parameter, intended to specify the address that can claim management fees and own the pool, lacks validation against being set to the zero address (address(0)). This oversight might potentially affect the contract's fee management and ownership functionalities.

## Impact
If the maintainer is set to the zero address, it could disrupt the intended flow of management fee collection and pose challenges in pool management. This could lead to scenarios where fees meant for the maintainer are locked.

}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a validation check in the init function to ensure the maintainer address is not the zero address. This will prevent the contract from being initialized with an invalid maintainer address.
