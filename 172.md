# DoS when `_MT_FEE_QUOTE_` and/or `_MT_FEE_BASE_` get too big

## Summary
An issue has been identified in the smart contract where accumulating fees, tracked by `_MT_FEE_BASE_` and `_MT_FEE_QUOTE_`, could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract tracks fees through `_MT_FEE_BASE_` and `_MT_FEE_QUOTE_`, which increase with `sellQuote()`, `sellBase()`, and `flashLoan()` calls. The only reduction mechanism is the `withdrawMtFeeTotal()` function, accessible to the maintainer.

## Impact
If the maintainer fails to regularly withdraw fees, these variables could grow large enough to cause DoS, impacting critical functions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a mechanism to periodically or automatically manage fee withdrawals or limit fee accumulation to prevent overflow and DoS scenarios.
