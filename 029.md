# Integer Overflow in _BASE_TARGET_ Downcast

## Summary
The buyShares function in the provided smart contract is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue during the downcast of the shares variable to the _BASE_TARGET_ variable. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the buyShares function, the _BASE_TARGET_ variable is assigned the value of shares , which is uint256, after it has been calculated. However, the downcast operation from uint256 to uint112 could result in an integer overflow if the calculated value of shares exceeds the maximum representable value for a uint112.

If the value of shares is greater than 2^112 - 1, an overflow will occur during the downcast, leading to unexpected and potentially incorrect values for _BASE_TARGET_. Integer overflows can have severe consequences, including unintended behavior and vulnerabilities.

## Impact
The integer overflow in the downcast of _BASE_TARGET_ may lead to distorted internal accounting, affecting the accuracy of calculations and allocations within the contract. 
This, in turn, will result in financial losses for users relying on the correct functioning of the decentralized exchange.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPFunding.sol#L63

       function buyShares(address to)
        external
        nonReentrant
        returns (
            uint256 shares,
           ..
        )
     {
    ...
            _BASE_TARGET_ = uint112(shares);
     }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Perform a check for integer overflow
require(shares <= type(uint112).max, "Integer overflow in _BASE_TARGET_ downcast");
