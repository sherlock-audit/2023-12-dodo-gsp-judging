# `mintRatio` in GSPFunding.buyShares() uses lesser input ratio to calculate shares, this could cause discrepancies between funds deposited by users and shares minted  for users

## Summary
The issue lies in how `mintRatio` is calculated [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPFunding.sol#L69).
## Vulnerability Detail
GSPFunding.buyShares() selects the smaller of the two values (quoteInputRatio and baseInputRatio) when calculating the `mintRatio` which is wrong as the token with more deposit from the user won't really have an influence on the shares minted for the user.

For example if a user deposits more base tokens( lets say 10000$ dai) than quote tokens( lets say 3000$ usdc) when buying shares (i.e,  calling GSPFunding.buyShares()), `mintRatio` will be quoteInputRatio and not baseInputRatio which will be a loss for the user as 7000$ worth of shares is unaccounted for in the shares allocated to the user. 
 
## Impact
High severity as the token with more deposit from users won't influence users shares. This is loss of funds because user will lose % of funds that he deposited that didn't reflect in his shares.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the greater of the two values (quoteInputRatio and baseInputRatio) when calculating the `mintRatio`. That way, the higher input ratio will influence user's shares.
