# Target Reserves Can Go Out of Sync

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

Target Reserves is changed to matched the underlying values. This happens in all liquidity add/deposits, token swaps and flashloan functions.

However, in a direct call to `sync` the target reserves cannot be updated. When liquidity is low, an attacker could donate tokens directly and then call `sync` to make the change the base token reserves and quote token reserves while not changing the target reserves, which could result in a incorrect liquidity curve.

## Impact

Target reserves can get out of sync which makes the underlying liquidity curve different than it should be. This will result in a lower or higher price impact (depending on the swap direction and change in liquidity curve) than there should be during swaps.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Also update target reserves during `sync` or remove/add access controls to the external non-access controlled `sync` function
