# Incorrect initial supply calculations if the base token has not 18 decimals

## Summary
The `mulFloor` and `divFloor` operations utilize 18 decimals. Using a base token with a different number of decimals can lead to incorrect calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail
Initial shares supply is calculated by determining the amount of the base token at the price of the quote token and comparing it. If the base token has 18 decimals, the result of this conversion will match the number of decimals of the quote token. However, if the base token has a different number of decimals, the result of this operation may be zero or a value with a different number of decimals than `quoteBalance`. This makes the comparison unfair.

Moreover, the total initial supply of shares may also have the wrong number of decimals if they are calculated using the quote token.

```solidity
shares = quoteBalance < DecimalMath.mulFloor(baseBalance, _I_)
                ? DecimalMath.divFloor(quoteBalance, _I_)
                : baseBalance;
```

## Impact
This vulnerability can lead to incorrect shares total supply, incorrect base token target, and incorrect exchange price.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When performing arithmetic operations, consider the number of decimals of the base token.
