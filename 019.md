# GSPTrader.sol - target values are incorrectly updated at the end of selling

## Summary
The ``sellBase()`` and ``sellQuote()`` functions both execute a token swap through the PMM algorithm and based on the current state and R value, a different formula is used for computing amounts out. Depending on the R value, the PMM may alter the target values, B0 or Q0, which with the current implementation do not get saved after the swap, potentially impacting future swaps.

## Vulnerability Detail
Both sell functions utilize their query internal functions that:
1. Get the current PMM (a bunch of storage variables)
2. The PMM adjusts the target value of the swap based on the current R value
3. In case we are in a below_one, the Q0 will get adjusted, B0 otherwise
4. We can have a case where we swap B->Q, but we are still in a below market so Q0 will be the variable changed
5. At the end of the swap, after the calculations(which use that altered Q0), we update only the target variable of the given function, base for the ``sellBase()`` and quote for the ``sellQuote()`` instead of both, effectively leaving them unchanged

So some B->Q swaps (aboove-one) successfully update B0 and the target, but other B->Q who update the Q0 instead of leave the target with the old value.
The same is applied for the Q->B swaps.

## Impact
Target values are an essential part of the math behind the PMM, leaving the values unupdated would impact future swaps

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update both target amounts after the swap.
