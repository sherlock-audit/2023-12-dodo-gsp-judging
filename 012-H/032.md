# Flash Loan Function Allows Unauthorized Operations

## Summary
The flashLoan function in the provided smart contract lacks proper validation on the assetTo address, allowing potential attackers to drain funds by setting it to a malicious smart contract. The vulnerability arises from the execution of the DSPFlashLoanCall function on arbitrary addresses, enabling destructive operations like selfdestruct or unauthorized token transfers.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the flashLoan function, the contract transfers baseAmount and quoteAmount to the specified assetTo address without adequate validation. If an attacker sets assetTo to a malicious smart contract implementing the IDODOCallee interface with harmful logic in DSPFlashLoanCall, it can result in unauthorized operations, including draining funds from the decentralized exchange.

the malicious contract can be implemented like this:

    // Malicious contract implementing IDODOCallee interface
    contract MaliciousDODOCallee is IDODOCallee {
    function DSPFlashLoanCall(
        address sender,
        uint256 baseAmount,
        uint256 quoteAmount,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external override {
        // Example of malicious logic
        // Transfer all base tokens to the caller
        _BASE_TOKEN_.transfer(sender, _BASE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this)));

        // Transfer all quote tokens to the caller
        _QUOTE_TOKEN_.transfer(sender, _QUOTE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this)));
      
        // Selfdestruct the contract and send any remaining Ether to a custom address
        selfdestruct(address(this));
    }
    }

In this example, after transferring all the base and quote tokens to the caller (msg.sender), the contract invokes the selfdestruct operation, which renders the contract unusable and removes it from the Ethereum state. This is a destructive operation and should only be used for illustrative purposes in understanding potential vulnerabilities. In real-world scenarios, such operations could lead to permanent loss of contract functionality and funds.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is severe, potentially leading to financial losses for the decentralized exchange. An attacker could exploit the lack of validation to execute destructive operations, compromising the integrity of the flash loan mechanism and contract balance of tokens theft.

                baseAmount,
                quoteAmount,

            );

    }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the legitimacy of the assetTo address before transferring funds. Ensure that flash loans are only executed to trusted and secure addresses.
