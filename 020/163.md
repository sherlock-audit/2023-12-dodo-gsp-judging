# missing reentrency guard

## Summary
In the contract `GSPTrader.sol `, The `nonReentrant` keyword is used Without any proper imports from openzepplin or modifier,
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `GSPTrader` contract the   `sellBase` ,  `sellQuote` and `flashLoan` function have  `nonReentrant` modifier but  the openzepplin reentrency guard is not imported. 
While Solidity 0.8.16 introduced a built-in reentrancy guard, it's still recommended to use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard in most cases. Here's why:

- OpenZeppelin's implementation works seamlessly across different Solidity versions, ensuring consistent protection even in older codebases.
- It maintains a consistent approach to reentrancy protection across your contracts, promoting code readability and maintainability.
- OpenZeppelin's version offers a nonReentrant modifier with a notice parameter for logging reentrancy attempts, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
- OpenZeppelin's library can be easily upgraded to incorporate future improvements or address any discovered vulnerabilities, ensuring continuous security.
- Using OpenZeppelin's well-tested and widely adopted library aligns with industry best practices, fostering confidence in code security.
