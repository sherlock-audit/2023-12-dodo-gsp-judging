# Lack of Proper Slippage Controls can cause freezing of funds during High Volatility times

## Summary
According to Docs, "k(or state _K_)" is used as Slippage factor for the protocol but it is hardcoded to a specific value which becomes ineffective in times of high volatility.
## Vulnerability Detail
Docs of PMM algorithm given by the Protocol Team describes "k" as the slippage factor as can be seen here:
https://docs.dodoex.io/en/product/pmm-algorithm/details-about-pmm
The same algorithm is used for the calculation of the price of Base/Quote in GSPTrader.sol, i.e., when trader has to sell base token he would use `GSPTrader.sol#sellBase` to sell it which has the call flow as  `GSPTrader.sol#sellBase-> GSPTrader.sol#querySellBase -> PMMPricing.sol#sellBaseToken -> PMMPricing.sol#_ROneSellQuoteToken -> DODOMath#_SolveQuadraticFunctionForTrade` [for state.R == RState.ONE] , using the PMM algorithm with the formula same as defined in the algorithm i.e.,
```solidity
 i*deltaB = (Q2-Q1)*(1-k+kQ0^2/Q1/Q2)
 ```
 where k stands for slippage factor. The problem here is that , at the times of high volatility, the Trader might not be able to get their desired amount of Quote tokens for the supplied base tokens as the slippage factor here is Hardcoded(and there is no way to change the slippage factor[k] but similar functions have been added for other important variable as i[is the initial "guide price"] at GSPvault.sol#adjustPrice). Hardcoded slippage causes freezing of User funds and the User might not be able to sell their Base Tokens due to this condition in `DODOMath.sol`:

 ```solidity
  uint256 V2 = DecimalMath.divCeil(numerator, denominator);
        if (V2 > V1) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            return V1 - V2;
        }
    }
  ```
where if the V2 calculated is not big enough, then it might not be able to transfer funds to the User as the value is passed back onto the `GSPTrader.sol#sellBase` will be 0.

  ```solidity
   _transferQuoteOut(to, receiveQuoteAmount);
   ```  
## Impact
Freezing of funds and preventing Users from selling their Base/Quote token.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a function in `GSPVault.sol` , similar to `adjustPrice` function to adjust the slippage factor in times of high volatility.
