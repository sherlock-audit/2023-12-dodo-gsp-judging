# zero address  verification for owner

## Summary
The contract does not include any checks for the zero address when setting a new owner, which could be a potential oversight. It's generally a good idea to prevent the zero address from becoming an owner, as it cannot execute transactions.
## Vulnerability Detail
 initOwner(address newOwner) 
## Impact
We have to check for the zero address for the _OWNER.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/lib/InitializableOwnable.sol#L42
function initOwner(address newOwner) public notInitialized {
        _INITIALIZED_ = true;
        _OWNER_ = newOwner;
    }
