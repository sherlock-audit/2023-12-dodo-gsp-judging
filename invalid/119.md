# Cross-contract reentrancy via correctRState

## Summary
'correctRState' is not marked with `nonReentrant`, leading to potential ReadOnly-like reentrancy attacks on protocols that can possibly depend on DODO data. Protocol itslef in not affected. 

## Vulnerability Detail
'correctRState' can lead to change of state and is not  `nonReentrant`, allowing to change state for `_BASE_TARGET_` and `_QUOTE_TARGET_` variables. These variable are used in formulas for price impact and calculations and are accessible outside. Combined with flash-loan capability or ERC777-like compatible tokens, this can lead to potential "ReadOnly"-like reentrancy threats. 

## Impact
MEDIUM - it doesn't not seem that protocol itself if affected - only potential integrations.
