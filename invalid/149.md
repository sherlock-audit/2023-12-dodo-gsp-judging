# Division by Zero

## Summary
Division by Zero: None of the division functions (div, divFloor, divCeil, reciprocalFloor, reciprocalCeil) check for division by zero, which will cause a revert. It is important to ensure that the divisor is never zero when calling these functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
div, divFloor, divCeil, reciprocalFloor, reciprocalCeil will revert as we can be be dividing by 0.
## Impact
Function will be revert as division functions (div, divFloor, divCeil, reciprocalFloor, reciprocalCeil)  doesnot check for division by zero,

## Recommendation
use require statement to check for the division by zero.
