# Proxy and upgradable tokens (like TUSD) can cause issues to the protocol

## Summary

Tokens whose code and logic can be changed in future can break the protocol and lock user funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol doesn't handle fee-on-transfer/rebasing/deflationary tokens, users will be unable to trade tokens or sell shares due to not enough assets in the contract. 

## Impact

The protocol will be unable to pay enough tokens to users when users want to swap tokens or sell their shares.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Consider introducing logic that will freeze/pause interactions with the token in question if an upgrade is detected
- Consider a token whitelist which does not allow such tokens.
