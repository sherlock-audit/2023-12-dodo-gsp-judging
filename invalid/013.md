# Inadequate Reserve Control Leads to Potential Price Impact

## Summary

The `GSPFunding.sol` contract employs the `_setReserve` function from `GSPVault.sol` internally, intending to manage pool reserves. However, the current implementation doesn't adequately account for potential imbalances caused by disproportionately large share purchases, potentially affecting subsequent transactions' token prices.

## Vulnerability Detail

Within the `GSPFunding.sol` contract, the `buyShares` function utilizes `_setReserve(baseBalance, quoteBalance);` to update the pool reserves. This action is intended to manage reserve balances based on users' token purchases. However, the `_setReserve` function in `GSPVault.sol` has a fixed mechanism to update reserves without considering the proportion of tokens locked up as shares. Consequently, if a user acquires a substantial number of shares, the reserves increase proportionately, which requires subsequent buyers to acquire more tokens than the underlying reserves. This process could lead to an imbalance in the reserve-to-share ratio, potentially impacting token prices.

## Impact

The current implementation of reserve management can lead to a skewed reserve ratio concerning shares. As a result, subsequent users engaging in token purchases might need to acquire larger amounts of tokens than what the reserves initially suggest, potentially causing price imbalances and volatility in the pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Revise the reserve control mechanism to consider the proportion of tokens locked as shares when updating reserves. Implement a dynamic reserve adjustment that factors in the share-to-reserve ratio, ensuring that subsequent token purchases align with the actual reserves and prevent disproportionate impacts on token prices.
