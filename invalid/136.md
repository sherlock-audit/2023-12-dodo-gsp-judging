# centralization Risk:

## Summary
centralization Risk: The contract has several functions that can only be called by the maintainer, which introduces centralization risk. If the maintainer's address is compromised, the attacker could potentially manipulate the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
 modifier onlyMaintainer() {
        require(msg.sender == _MAINTAINER_, "ACCESS_DENIED");
        _;
    }

## Impact
If the maintainer's address is compromised, the attacker could potentially manipulate the contract.
