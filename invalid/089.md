# Overestimation of Redeemable Tokens in `GSPFunding.sol`

## Summary
The `sellShares` function in the `GSPFunding.sol` contract may allow redeemers to receive more base and quote tokens than they are entitled to. This issue arises due to the method of calculating the available token balances, which includes tokens that may have been sent to the contract address directly or accidentally.


## Vulnerability Detail
In the `sellShares` function, the available balances of base and quote tokens are calculated using the contract's total token balance (`_BASE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this))` and `_QUOTE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this))`). However, this approach does not account for tokens that might have been sent to the contract's address outside of the intended deposit mechanisms. As a result, these externally sent tokens are incorrectly included in the redeemable balance, potentially allowing redeemers to withdraw more than their share.

## Impact
If additional tokens are sent to the contract address, either intentionally or accidentally, they would be included in the redeemable pool. This could lead to an unfair distribution of these extra tokens among the redeemers, potentially depleting the contract's reserves and affecting its financial integrity.


## Code Snippet
- **Location of Issue**: [GSPFunding.sol#L106](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPFunding.sol#L106)
- **Relevant Code Section**:
  ```solidity
  uint256 baseBalance = _BASE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this)) - _MT_FEE_BASE_; 
  uint256 quoteBalance = _QUOTE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this)) - _MT_FEE_QUOTE_;
  ```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of relying on the balanceOf function to determine the redeemable token amounts, the contract should internally track the total supply of both base and quote tokens (totalBaseTokens, totalQuoteTokens).
Implement internal accounting for all token deposit and withdrawal operations to accurately reflect the actual token amounts that should be available for redemption.
This change will ensure that the redeemable token amounts are calculated based on the intended deposits and withdrawals, excluding any external token transfers to the contract address.
