# The ```_approve``` function is vulnerable to front-running

## Summary

The [```_approve```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPVault.sol#L275-L282) function of the [```GSPVault```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPVault.sol) contract (directly callable through the [```approve```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPVault.sol#L270-L273) function of the same contract marked as ```public```), is setting a new value for  ```_ALLOWED_[owner][spender]``` without checking for the previously set allowance. 

This makes it vulnerable to front-running.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let’s have a look at the [```_approve```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPVault.sol#L275-L282) function below

```solidity
    function _approve(
        address owner,
        address spender,
        uint256 amount
    ) private {
        _ALLOWED_[owner][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(owner, spender, amount);
    }
```

Let’s say ```Bob``` initially allows ```Alice``` to transfer ```10 _SHARES_``` on his behalf via the ```approve``` function.

At a later stage, he wishes to decrease this allowance to ```5 _SHARES_```, he then calls the ```approve``` function again, with ```spender == Alice``` and ```amount == 5```.

At the same time, ```Alice``` calls the [```transferFrom```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPVault.sol#L250-L263) function below, with more gas than ```Bob``` and parameters ```from == Bob```, ```to == Alice``` and ```amount == 10```

```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) public returns (bool) {
        require(amount <= _SHARES_[from], "BALANCE_NOT_ENOUGH");
        require(amount <= _ALLOWED_[from][msg.sender], "ALLOWANCE_NOT_ENOUGH");

        _SHARES_[from] = _SHARES_[from] - amount;
        _SHARES_[to] = _SHARES_[to] + amount;
        _ALLOWED_[from][msg.sender] = _ALLOWED_[from][msg.sender] - amount;
        emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

Her transaction will be executed first (as having a higher amount of gas attached to it), followed by the ```approve``` call initiated by ```Bob```, resetting ```_ALLOWED_[Bob][Alice]``` to ```5```.

Alice is then able to transfer another ```5 _SHARES_```, meaning a total of ```15 _SHARES```, which she should not have been allowed to transfer.

## Impact

We label this vulnerability as ```HIGH``` as the [```transferFrom```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPVault.sol#L250-L263) function could then be misused, resulting in a user transferring more ```_SHARES_``` (to themselves or another account) than previously allowed to. 
This potentially leads to a loss of ```_SHARES_ ```for the from user.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPVault.sol#L270-L282

```solidity
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
        _approve(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        return true;
    }

    function _approve(
        address owner,
        address spender,
        uint256 amount
    ) private {
        _ALLOWED_[owner][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(owner, spender, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review / Visual Studio

## Recommendation

It is good practice to call the [```safeIncreaseAllowance```](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/3e6c86392c97fbc30d3d20a378a6f58beba08eba/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L52-L55) and [```safeDecreaseAllowance```](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/3e6c86392c97fbc30d3d20a378a6f58beba08eba/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L61-L69) as defined by OpenZeppelin’s ```SafeERC20``` implementation.

These are not vulnerable to front-running and increase or decrease the existing allowance rather than setting new values directly.
