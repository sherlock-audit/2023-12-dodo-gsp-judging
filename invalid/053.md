# Interoperability Issue: Incorrect Value of Version Used to Compute the Domain Separator

## Summary
The GSP contract is facing an interoperability issue where the version used to encode the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR for permit functionality is different from the actual value returned by the version view function. This discrepancy impacts the core functionality the protocol, specifically the permit feature.

## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability is the mismatch between the version used in encoding the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR and the actual value returned by the version function. 

```solidity
// Findings are labeled with '<= FOUND'
// File: dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSP.sol
34:    function init(
        ...
91:                keccak256(bytes("1")), // <= FOUND: version used to encode DOMAIN_SEPARATOR is different from the actual value returned from version() function
        ...
97:    }
...
// File: dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSP.sol
120:    function version() external pure returns (string memory) {
121:        return "GSP 1.0.1"; // <= FOUND
122:    }
```

The vulnerability involves a scenario where external web applications request a user's signature-based approvals via the eth_signTypedData method. This method requires the integration web application to construct a TypedData structure for the user to sign. The [EIP-712 Spec](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) describes the TypedData structure as follows:

```text
Typed data is a JSON object containing type information, domain separator parameters and the message object. Below is the json-schema definition for TypedData param.
```

In the context of GSP, the TypedData structure includes parameters such as the name, version, and other domain-specific information. These parameters are hashed together to create a DOMAIN_SEPARATOR, a crucial component for generating a valid signature when using the permit functionality.

The vulnerability arises due to a mismatch in the version parameter used to construct the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR within GSPVault and the actual value returned by the version() function of the contract. The version information is a critical part of the TypedData structure and, subsequently, the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR.

When an external web application, like Uniswap, interacts with GSP, it typically prepares for the "domain separator parameters" by querying the contract for version information through endpoints such as version(). The web application then constructs the TypedData structure using this version information. However, if the version used in encoding DOMAIN_SEPARATOR within GSP contract does not match the version returned by the version() function, the web application will present incorrect domain parameters to the user for signing.

As a result, when the user signs the data presented by the web application, the signature becomes invalid because it is based on mismatched version information. This invalid signature, in turn, renders the permit functionality unusable, impacting the intended interoperability between the GSP contract and external applications relying on the eth_signTypedData method for approvals.

## Impact
The interoperability issue results in a core functionality impact on GSP protocol, specifically regarding the permit feature. The mismatched version values can cause invalid signatures, rendering the permit function unusable.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to use the actual value returned by the version function instead of a hardcoded value for encoding DOMAIN_SEPARATOR. This ensures consistency and correct interoperability with external applications relying on the permit feature.
