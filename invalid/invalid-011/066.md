# Missing Min Amount and Deadline Parameters in Swap Functions

## Summary
The `sellBase` and `sellQuote` functions lack crucial parameters, namely `minAmountOut` and `deadline`, which are commonly used in decentralized exchanges to protect users from undesirable rates, slippage, and front-running.

## Vulnerability Detail
The absence of `minAmountOut` and `deadline` parameters exposes users to potential risks such as receiving an unexpected amount of tokens and lacking a time constraint for transaction execution. These parameters are essential for improving user protection and ensuring fair and secure transactions.

## Impact
- **Unprotected Users:** Without a `minAmountOut` parameter, users are vulnerable to receiving amounts below their expectations, leading to potential losses or undesirable trading outcomes.
- **Missing Time Constraint:** The absence of a `deadline` parameter exposes users to the risk of front-running attacks or delays in transaction execution.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPTrader.sol#L40


```solidity
function sellBase(address to) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 receiveQuoteAmount) {
    // .........
    _transferQuoteOut(to, receiveQuoteAmount);
    _MT_FEE_QUOTE_ = _MT_FEE_QUOTE_ + mtFee;

    if (_RState_ != uint32(newRState)) {    
        require(newBaseTarget <= type(uint112).max, "OVERFLOW");
        _BASE_TARGET_ = uint112(newBaseTarget);
        _RState_ = uint32(newRState);
        emit RChange(newRState);
    }

    _setReserve(baseBalance, _QUOTE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this)) - _MT_FEE_QUOTE_);

    emit DODOSwap(
        address(_BASE_TOKEN_),
        address(_QUOTE_TOKEN_),
        baseInput,
        receiveQuoteAmount,
        msg.sender,
        to
    );
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to include the following parameters in both the `sellBase` and `sellQuote` functions:
1. **minAmountOut:** A parameter allowing users to set a threshold for the minimum acceptable amount of tokens to be received.
2. **deadline:** A parameter specifying a time limit for the transaction, protecting against front-running and ensuring timely execution.
