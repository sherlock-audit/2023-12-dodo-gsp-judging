# `sellBase` and  `sellQuote` do not implement any slippage protection

## Summary
The current price of base/quote token may vary based on current state of the reserves as in any other AMM solution. Therefore its important that on every operation that includes relying on this price, users were able to set the minimal price (allowed slippage) and deadline for the transaction, which is not possible in `sellBase` and `sellQuote`.

## Vulnerability Detail

- functions [sellBase](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPTrader.sol#L40) and [sellQuote](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/GasSavingPool/impl/GSPTrader.sol#L79) do not implement any protection against slippage. It is not sure that they will return fair amount of assets and if not, user cannot do anything with it.

## Impact
Users may suffer losses, intentionally (due to MEV bots, sandwiching, etc.) or unintentionally (due to natural volatility) when interacting with the application on a daily basis, without additional preconditions for it to happen.

## Code Snippet
For case 1 to prove that there is a volatility that affects amount of received shares, consider following PoC added to `GSPVault.t.sol` run with `forge test --fork-url $INFURA_MAINNET --mt test_protytype_slippage_poc -vv`

```solidity

function test_protytype_slippage_poc() public {
        //fund alice
        vm.prank(DAI_WHALE);
        dai.transfer(alice, 1_000_000 * 1e18);
        vm.prank(USDC_WHALE);
        usdc.transfer(alice, 1_000_000 * 1e6);
        //console.log(usdc.balanceOf(alice));
        //console.log(dai.balanceOf(alice));

        //fund bob
        vm.prank(DAI_WHALE);
        dai.transfer(bob, 100_000 * 1e18);
        vm.prank(USDC_WHALE);
        usdc.transfer(bob, 100_000 * 1e6);
        //console.log(usdc.balanceOf(bob));
        //console.log(dai.balanceOf(bob));

        //provide liquidity (buy shares) with some regualr liquidity
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        dai.transfer(address(gsp), 10_000 * 1e18); 
        usdc.transfer(address(gsp), 10_000 * 1e6); 
        gsp.buyShares(alice);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // sellbase
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        dai.transfer(address(gsp), 1_000 * 1e18);
        uint256 recv = gsp.sellBase(bob);
        console.log("Bob received 1:", recv);
        vm.stopPrank();


        //provide liquidity (buy shares) - some imbalanced pool state which happens organically or a sandwich attack
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        dai.transfer(address(gsp), 930_024* 1e18); 
        usdc.transfer(address(gsp), 2_234* 1e6); 
        gsp.buyShares(alice);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // again bob sells 1000 DAI for USDC
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        dai.transfer(address(gsp), 1_000 * 1e18);
        recv = gsp.sellBase(bob);
        console.log("Bob received 1:", recv);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

```


As you can see, prividing liquidity in different states of the pool reserves is subject to volatility and returns different amount of assets, therefore users should be able to control what they are getting back. Here bob always supply 1_000 DAI and gets different USDC amount - in second case gets 230 usdc for 1000 dai.

  Bob received 1: 999934452
  Bob received 1: 232148583 
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement slippage protection for each function that adds, removes or swaps liquidity - in a form of minimal amount of returned assets and a deadline.
