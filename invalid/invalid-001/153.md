# Frontrunning risks!

## Summary
The `GSPFunding `contract has a function` sellShares `which returns the `baseAmount` and `quoteAmount` and that may add the risks of Frontrunning 
## Vulnerability Detail
In `sellShares `function  returns the` baseAmount` and `quoteAmount` ,  here there may be risks of Frontrunning attack, the attacker can monitor these pending transactions and may try to front-run a users trade by submitting a transaction with slightly higher amounts.  
## Impact
The user may benefit the attacker and may cause the user few more money for the same trade, it also manipulates the market.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
set a threshold amount limit (amount limit which says how much higher or lower the user is willing to pay for the particular transaction, if the frontrunning happens and the amount goes higher than threshold limit then the transaction reverts , hence protecting the user from the frontrunning attatks )
