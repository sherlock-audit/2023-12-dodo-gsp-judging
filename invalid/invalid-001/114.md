# Sandwich Attack Vulnerability in `GSPFunding.sol::sellShares()` Function

## Summary
A potential vulnerability to Sandwich Attacks exists in the `GSPFunding.sol::sellShares()` . This type of attack could lead to financial losses for users by manipulating the market price before and after the victim's transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
The sellShares function allows users to sell their shares in exchange for base and quote tokens. The function's parameters, such as `baseMinAmount` and `quoteMinAmount`, are intended to provide slippage protection. 

Because `baseMinAmount` and `quoteMinAmount` can be an arbitrary value and can be set to 0, the attacker can use it to always guarantee to deliver the minimum that the user expects and take a profit. This manipulation can result in the victim receiving a significantly worse price for their shares than expected.

## Impact
The impact of such an attack is significant. It can lead to users receiving less value for their shares than intended.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
"We recommend implementing a two-step verification mechanism for transactions. This addition would involve a preliminary check of the transaction against potential price manipulation patterns, followed by the execution of the trade.
