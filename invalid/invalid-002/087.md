# Front-Running Vulnerability in `InitializableOwnable.sol` Due to Lack of Access Control

## Summary
The `initOwner` function in the `InitializableOwnable.sol` contract is exposed to a serious security risk due to the absence of access control. This function, which is intended to set the initial owner of the contract, can be called by any user, making it vulnerable to front-running attacks.


## Vulnerability Detail
In its current implementation, the `initOwner` function does not restrict who can call it. As a result, any external actor can set the owner of the contract, potentially seizing control before the legitimate owner has a chance to initialize it. This vulnerability is particularly critical because it concerns the ownership control of the contract.


## Impact
If an attacker successfully front-runs the legitimate initialization transaction, they could set themselves or an arbitrary address as the owner of the contract. This could lead to a complete takeover of the contract, allowing the attacker to manipulate its behavior and potentially causing irreparable damage.


## Code Snippet
- **Location of Issue**: [InitializableOwnable.sol#L42-L45](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-dodo-gsp/blob/main/dodo-gassaving-pool/contracts/lib/InitializableOwnable.sol#L42-L45)
- **Relevant Code Section**:
  ```solidity
  function initOwner(address newOwner) public notInitialized {
      _INITIALIZED_ = true;
      _OWNER_ = newOwner;
  }
  ```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement an access control mechanism to ensure that only a designated address (such as a deployer or a factory contract) can call the initOwner function. This can be achieved by adding an onlyOwner modifier or a similar custom access control check.
The modified initOwner function should include a check to ensure that only authorized users can initialize the owner, such as:
```solidity
function initOwner(address newOwner) public onlyOwner notInitialized {
    _INITIALIZED_ = true;
    _OWNER_ = newOwner;
}

```
Implementing this change will prevent unauthorized users from seizing control of the contract, thereby protecting it from front-running attacks and ensuring that only legitimate actors can set its ownership.
