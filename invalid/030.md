# Flashloan Manipulation Exploit in buyShares and sellShares Functions

## Summary
The provided smart contract is vulnerable to a flashloan manipulation exploit, enabling an attacker to manipulate the share prices and potentially profit unfairly. The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper checks and balances during the buy and sell operations, allowing for the exploitation of flashloans to artificially inflate share prices and subsequently profit from the manipulated state.

## Vulnerability Detail
Exploitable Scenario:
Flashloan Initialization:

An attacker utilizes a flashloan to acquire a significant amount of baseToken without affecting the contract's initial state.
Flashloan-Induced BuyShares Exploit:

The attacker calls the buyShares function with the flashloaned baseToken, artificially inflating the _BASE_TARGET_ and _QUOTE_TARGET_ variables.
The attacker exploits the share ratio distortion, potentially obtaining a disproportionately large share of the pool.
Flashloan Repayment and SellShares Exploit:

The attacker performs a flashloan repayment, selling the inflated shares back to the contract.
The _BASE_TARGET_ and _QUOTE_TARGET_ variables are adjusted incorrectly, leading to a distorted state.
The attacker profits from the price distortion, potentially causing financial losses for other users.

## Impact
The impact of this flashloan manipulation exploit is significant and can result in financial losses for honest users. The attacker can leverage flashloans to manipulate share prices, distort the internal state of the contract, and profit unfairly at the expense of other users who interact with the decentralized exchange.

    function sellShares(
        uint256 shareAmount,
        address to,
        uint256 baseMinAmount,
        uint256 quoteMinAmount,
        bytes calldata data,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 baseAmount, uint256 quoteAmount) {
        ..
        // The balance of baseToken and quoteToken should be the balance minus the fee
        uint256 baseBalance = _BASE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this)) - _MT_FEE_BASE_;
        uint256 quoteBalance = _QUOTE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this)) - _MT_FEE_QUOTE_;
        // The total shares of GSP
        uint256 totalShares = totalSupply;

        // The amount of baseToken and quoteToken user will receive is calculated by the ratio of user's shares to total shares
        baseAmount = baseBalance * shareAmount / totalShares;
        quoteAmount = quoteBalance * shareAmount / totalShares;
        ....
        _burn(msg.sender, shareAmount);
        _transferBaseOut(to, baseAmount);
        _transferQuoteOut(to, quoteAmount);
        _sync();
    ...
    }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement safeguards to limit the extent to which the contract adjusts internal variables based on flashloan-induced transactions. This can prevent excessive distortion of share prices.
