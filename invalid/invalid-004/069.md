# Pool with TWAP DoS due to overflows

## Summary
The Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) algorithm permits the elapsed time and cumulative price values to overflow. GSP is an upgraded version of DODO V2 DSP, which was originally written using Solidity 0.6.9, where arithmetic operations overflow and underflow by default. However, all contracts within GSP utilize Solidity 0.8.16, where such operations will be reverted.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `blockTimestamp` variable employs modulo division to cast its value into a 32-bit integer.

```solidity
 uint32 blockTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp % 2**32);
```

Over time, `blockTimestamp` will become less than `_BLOCK_TIMESTAMP_LAST_`, leading to an underflow during the `timeElapsed` calculation.

```solidity
uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _BLOCK_TIMESTAMP_LAST_;
```

The `_BASE_PRICE_CUMULATIVE_LAST_` variable accumulates prices from the moment a pool is initiated. This value can only increase until it overflows.

```solidity
_BASE_PRICE_CUMULATIVE_LAST_ += getMidPrice() * timeElapsed;
```

## Impact
This vulnerability could lead to permanent denial of service for a pool. Transactions such as exchanges, `buyShares`, or `sellShares` would no longer be possible. Consequently, all funds would be locked within the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the `unchecked` block to ensure everything overflows as expected.
