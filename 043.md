# `transferFrom` uses allowance even if spender == from

## Summary
A large number of protocol handle tokens (withdrwals, claims etc) using the transferFrom method (pull only) instead of using both transfer and transferFrom (push and pull). The current `transferFrom` implementation attempts to use allowance, when the owner i.e spender == from. Note that the ERC20 standard only does an allowance check when spender != from.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `transferFrom`` function.

```solidity
    function transferFrom( 
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) public returns (bool) {
        require(amount <= _SHARES_[from], "BALANCE_NOT_ENOUGH");
        require(amount <= _ALLOWED_[from][msg.sender], "ALLOWANCE_NOT_ENOUGH"); //@note

        _SHARES_[from] = _SHARES_[from] - amount; 
        _SHARES_[to] = _SHARES_[to] + amount;
        _ALLOWED_[from][msg.sender] = _ALLOWED_[from][msg.sender] - amount;
        emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
        return true;
    }

```
An an example protocol [type](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/c9297ccd925ebb2c44dbc6eaa3effd8db5d2368a/core-contracts/contracts/CoreCollection.sol#L173-L177) that implements the only transferFrom withdrawal method. 

## Impact
This will result in the tokens being untransferrable and therefore becoming irreversibly stranded in these protocols.
