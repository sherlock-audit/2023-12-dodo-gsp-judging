# GSP.sol :: Hardcoded chainId can provocate a possible replay attacks between chains in the event of a future chain split.

## Summary
The **chainId** is utilized to generate the **DOMAIN_SEPARATOR** for creating a signature to be used in **`permit()`**. However, hardcoding it poses a vulnerability. In the event of a chain split, it could lead to replay attacks across chains.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the documentation, it's mentioned that the protocol will be deployed across various blockchains including:

*Ethereum, Arbitrum, Aurora, Avalanche, BSC, Base, Boba, Conflux, Goerli Testnet, Linea, Manta, Mantle, MoonRiver, OKChain, Optimism, Polygon, Scroll, and X1 Testnet.* 

There's a future risk that any of these blockchains might undergo a chain split, potentially allowing the signature to be used on both chains.

While [ERC-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612) recommends a dynamic approach, the protocol currently hardcodes this information during deployment.

*If the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR contains the chainId and is defined at contract deployment instead of reconstructed for every signature, there is a risk of possible replay attacks between chains in the event of a future chain split.*

Protocol code:
```Solidity
uint256 chainId;
        assembly {
            chainId := chainid()
        }
        // DOMAIN_SEPARATOR is used for approve by signature
        DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = keccak256(
            abi.encode(
                // keccak256('EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)'),
                0x8b73c3c69bb8fe3d512ecc4cf759cc79239f7b179b0ffacaa9a75d522b39400f,
                keccak256(bytes(name)),
                keccak256(bytes("1")),
                chainId,
                address(this)
            )
        );
```
## Impact
Risk of replay attacks across chains leading to potential loss of funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review.
## Recommendation
Reconstruct the **DOMAIN_SEPARATOR** using **`chainId()`** for each signature to eliminate replay attacks in the event of a chain split.
```Solidity
DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = keccak256(
            abi.encode(
                // keccak256('EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)'),
                0x8b73c3c69bb8fe3d512ecc4cf759cc79239f7b179b0ffacaa9a75d522b39400f,
                keccak256(bytes(name)),
                keccak256(bytes("1")),
                chainId(),
                address(this)
            )
        );
```
