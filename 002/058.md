# Signature replay attacks are possible in case of hard fork due to domain separator being defined at deployment

## Summary
The `chainId` parameter in the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is defined at deployment in `GSP::init` function. In the event of a post-deployment chain fork, the `chainID` and `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` can not be updated, and the signatures may be replayed across both versions of the chain.

## Vulnerability Detail
This protocol uses EIP712 domain separator for permit functionality and approving with signatures. This domain separator is defined in the init function during deployment, which is a security consideration in case of future chain splits/forks.

Let's check the [security considerations in EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#security-considerations), which is permit extension for signed approvals.

> If the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` contains the `chainId` and is defined at contract deployment instead of reconstructed for every signature, there is a risk of possible replay attacks between chains in the event of a future chain split.

As we can see in the code above, `chainId` is derived with yul and hardcoded when creating domain separator. So in case of a hard fork `DOMAIN_SEPATOR` will remain the same and it will be possible to perform signature replay attacks.

The exact same issue can be found here: [https://solodit.xyz/issues/m-05-replay-attack-in-case-of-hard-fork-code4rena-golom-golom-contest-git](https://solodit.xyz/issues/m-05-replay-attack-in-case-of-hard-fork-code4rena-golom-golom-contest-git)

Similar finding can also be found here as [high severity in ToB audit](https://solodit.xyz/issues/risk-of-reuse-of-signatures-across-forks-due-to-lack-of-chainid-validation-trailofbits-looksrare-pdf).

The impact high. The likelihood would be low if it is deployed on ethereum only. However, according to the contest page, this protocol will be deployed on "*Ethereum, Arbitrum, Aurora, Avalanche, BSC, Base, Boba, Conflux, Goerli Testnet, Linea, Manta, Mantle, MoonRiver, OKChain, Optimism, Polygon, Scroll, X1 Testnet*", which makes the likelihood much higher. Therefore I believe it is high severity overall.

## Impact
Signatures can be replayed.

## Tool used

Manual Review, Solodit, EIP specification 

## Recommendation
The `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` variable should be recomputed for every signature as the EIP specification suggests. Using [OpenZeppelin's EIP712 ](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/EIP712.sol) contract would be helpful since it [caches the domain separator, checks and rebuilds if necessary](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/abcf9dd8b78ca81ac0c3571a6ce9831235ff1b4c/contracts/utils/cryptography/EIP712.sol#L80C3-L86C6).
