# Lack of chainID validation allows reuse of signatures across forks

## Summary
The chainID is set at initializing and can't be changed. In the event of a post-deployment chain hard fork, the chainID cannot be updated, and signatures may be replayed across both versions of the chain.

## Vulnerability Detail
A domain separator and the chainID are included in the signature schema at the `GSPVault.permit` function.

However, this chainID is fixed at the time of initializing.

In the event of a post-deployment chain hard fork, the chainID cannot be updated, and signatures may be replayed across both versions of the chain. As a result, an attacker could reuse signatures to receive user funds on both chains.

## Impact
An attacker can reuse signatures to receive user funds in case of a post-deployment chain hard fork.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent post-deployment forks from affecting calls to permit, detect chainID changes and regenerate the domain separator when necessary.
